## ⚙️ How It Works

- `setInterval()` calls the `displayTime()` function every second.
- Clock hands are rotated using `transform: rotate(...)` with degree values:
  - Hour hand: `30 * hours + minutes / 2`
  - Minute hand: `6 * minutes`
  - Second hand: `6 * seconds`
- Custom properties (`--clr`, `--h`, `--i`) are used for colors, hand heights, and positioning numbers.
