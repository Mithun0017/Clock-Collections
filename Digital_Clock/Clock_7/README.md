### 🛠️ How It Works

- The `update()` function retrieves formatted time, day, and date using `strftime()`, updates the label widgets via `config()`, and then schedules itself to run again after 1000 ms using `window.after(1000, update)`, ensuring continuous updates without freezing the UI :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
  
- The UI components (`Label` widgets) are laid out using Tkinter’s `pack()` geometry manager for straightforward vertical stacking.

- Custom window styling (fonts, text colors, background, and icon) is applied through widget configuration and `PhotoImage` for a polished look.
